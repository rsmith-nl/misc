def calculix_plastic(Rp, Rm, em, steps=6, temp=293):
    """
    Calculate *PLASTIC properties for CalculiX.
    The calculation is basicall unit agnostic.
    However, Rp and Rm should be given in the same units and em should not be
    a percentage.

    Parameters:
        Rp: yield stress
        Rm: failure stress
        em: failure strain (dimensionless)
        steps: number of steps in the table
        temp: temperature for which the properties are valid

    Returns:
        A string containing the *PLASTIC data.

    Examples:
    >>> from ramberg_osgood import calculix_plastic
    >>> print(calculix_plastic(235, 435, 0.26, steps=5))
    *PLASTIC
